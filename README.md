# Spring Boot Security Project

This is a sample README file for a Spring Boot Security project. It provides an overview of the project and includes information about important methods used in the project.

## Project Description

This project is built using the Spring Boot framework and focuses on implementing security features for a web application. It utilizes the Spring Security module to handle authentication and authorization. The project aims to secure the application by configuring security filters and defining access rules for different HTTP requests.

## Methods

### SecurityFilterChain

The `SecurityFilterChain` is an interface provided by Spring Security. It represents a chain of filters that are responsible for processing incoming requests and applying security checks. In this project, you can configure the `SecurityFilterChain` to define the order and combination of security filters to be applied.

### HttpSecurity

The `HttpSecurity` class is the main class for configuring security rules in Spring Security. It allows you to define security configurations for specific HTTP requests. By customizing the `HttpSecurity` object, you can set authentication and authorization rules, specify which requests should be allowed or denied, and apply various security features.

### csrf()

The `csrf()` method is used to enable Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the application. CSRF is an attack that tricks the victim into submitting a malicious request. By invoking `csrf()`, you can configure Spring Security to generate and validate CSRF tokens for each request, mitigating the risk of CSRF attacks.

### authorizeHttpRequests

The `authorizeHttpRequests` method is used to define access rules for different HTTP requests. By using this method, you can specify which requests should be allowed or denied based on certain conditions. For example, you can restrict access to certain URLs or allow only authenticated users to access specific resources.

### requestMatchers

The `requestMatchers` method is used to specify which requests should be matched by the security configuration. It allows you to define patterns or conditions to selectively apply security rules. For example, you can match requests based on URLs or request methods.

### permitAll

The `permitAll` method is used to configure that certain requests should be allowed without any security restrictions. This is commonly used for public resources that don't require authentication or authorization. By using `permitAll`, you can bypass security checks for specific URLs or request patterns.

### formLogin

The `formLogin` method is used to enable form-based authentication in the application. It sets up the login page and configures the authentication process when a user submits the login form. By invoking `formLogin`, you can provide the login page URL, username and password parameter names, and the success/failure URLs after authentication.
